## Assignment

`Sneklang` is going to need objects. We'll hand-code those objects, and Sneklang developers will use them to store dynamic variables, kinda like Python. Everything is an object, even simple integers and strings!

Take a look at the `SnekObject` struct in `exercise.h`. It has a `kind` field that stores the type of the object (like `INTEGER` or `STRING`) and a `data` field that stores the actual data.

    1. Create a `snek_object_kind_t` enum type in `exercise.h`. It's the one used as the `kind` field of the provided `SnekObject`. It's an enum that can be an `INTEGER` (0) or a `STRING` (1).
    2. Complete the `format_object` function in `exercise.c` that uses a `switch` on the `.kind` of a `snek_object_t `and writes a formatted string to the associated buffer.
        1. For an integer, write the string `int:N` to the buffer, replacing `N` with the integer value
        2. For a string, write the string `string:STR` to the buffer, replacing `STR` with the string value

You can use `sprintf` to write the formatted string to the buffer. For example:
```c
char buffer[100];
sprintf(buffer, "There are %d lights!", 4); // There are 4 lights!
```
