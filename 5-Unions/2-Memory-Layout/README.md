Take a look at the `val_or_err_t` union. It represents either an integer value or an unsigned (non-negative) integer error code.

    1. Run the code in its current state.

Notice that the `.value` field is set to `-420`, then the data in each field is printed. The `.value` field works as you'd expect, printing `-420`. However, the `.err` field prints `4294966876`! It's trying to interpret the bytes of -420 as an unsigned integer, which results in a very large number.

    2. Uncomment the next block of code, and run it without submitting.

Notice that now we set the `.err` field (an unsigned integer) to `UINT_MAX`, which is a constant representing the largest possible unsigned integer (`4294967295` in my case). As expected, the .err field prints `4294967295`. However, the `.value` field prints `-1`! It’s reading the bytes for `4294967295` as a signed integer instead of an unsigned one, which turns it into `-1`.
