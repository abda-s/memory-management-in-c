# Introduction to Bitwise Operations

## Background
At the bare metal level, everything has to be implemented with physical connections. CPUs are designed to operate on a specific number of bits at once. 

When we perform normal arithmetic like `+` or `-`, the CPU operates on the entire word. Any carry generated by the lower bits will propagate upward. The value of an individual bit depends on its neighbors.

**Bitwise operations**, on the other hand, process each bit *independently*. Even though the CPU still reads and processes the whole chunk of memory at once, the result of each bit in the output depends *only* on the two bits in that exact position from the input words. There's no carry, no borrowing, and no influence from neighboring bits.

There are six main bitwise operations in C:
1. `&` (AND)
2. `|` (OR)
3. `^` (XOR)
4. `~` (NOT)
5. `<<` (Left Shift)
6. `>>` (Right Shift)

*Note: For these early lessons, we are going to use 8-bit integers (`uint8_t`) so the binary logic is easier to visualize in your head!*

## Assignment
Implement four functions in `exercise.c` using standard 8-bit unsigned integers (`uint8_t`).

1. `bitwise_and`: Takes two `uint8_t`, returns their bitwise AND.
2. `bitwise_or`: Takes two `uint8_t`, returns their bitwise OR.
3. `bitwise_xor`: Takes two `uint8_t`, returns their bitwise XOR.
4. `bitwise_shift_left`: Takes a `uint8_t val` and a `uint8_t shift_amount`, and shifts `val` to the left.
