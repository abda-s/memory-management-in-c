# Custom Practice: Advanced Pointers

This chapter is a custom addition, designed to bridge the gap between basic pointers and the more advanced pointer manipulations found in Chapter 6 and 7. It provides 13 fundamental practice exercises focusing heavily on pointer arithmetic, dereferencing, passing by reference, and basic dynamic memory (`malloc`).

Each folder inside this chapter contains a specific exercise. Navigate into an exercise, check its `README.md`, and complete the code inside the `starter/` directory. If you get stuck, check the `solution/` directory for the answer.
