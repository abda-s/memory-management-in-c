## Exercise 10: Reverse an Array

Practice Problem: Write a program to reverse an integer array in place (without using a second array) by swapping elements using pointers.

Given:
```c
int numbers[] = {1, 2, 3, 4, 5, 6};
```

Expected Output:
```
Original array: 1 2 3 4 5 6 
Reversed array: 6 5 4 3 2 1
```
