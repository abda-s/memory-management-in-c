## Exercise 9: Sum of Array Elements

Practice Problem: Write a function sum_array that accepts an integer pointer (the array base address) and the size of the array. The function must calculate and return the sum of all elements using pointer arithmetic for traversal.

Given:
```c
int numbers[] = {10, 5, 8, 2, 15};
```

Expected Output:
```
The sum of array elements is: 40
```
