## Exercise 12: String Copy

Practice Problem: Implement a function custom_strcpy that copies the content of a source string (src) to a destination string (dest) using only character pointers.

Given:
```c
char source[] = "Pointer Mastery";
char destination[50]; // Ensure destination buffer is large enough
```

Expected Output:
```
Source: Pointer Mastery
Destination: Pointer Mastery
```
