## Exercise 1: Declaration and Initialization
Practice Problem: Declare an integer variable, a pointer to an integer, and initialize the pointer to the address of the variable. Print both the variable’s value and the value accessed via the pointer.

Given:
```c
int var = 42;
```
Expected Output:
Memory Address can vary according to the system.
```
Variable 'var' value: 42
Variable 'var' address: 0x7ffc170d9ffc
Pointer 'ptr' address (value of ptr): 0x7ffc170d9ffc
Value accessed via pointer (*ptr): 42
```
