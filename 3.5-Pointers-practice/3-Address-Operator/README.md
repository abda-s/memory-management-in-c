## Exercise 3: Address Operator

Practice Problem: Print the memory addresses of two different variables (e.g., an int and a float) using the address-of operator (&). Additionally, print the address of a pointer variable itself.

Given:
```c
int a = 10;
float b = 20.5f;
```

Expected Output:
```
Address of integer variable 'a': 0x7ffdd91e2bd8
Address of float variable 'b': 0x7ffdd91e2bdc
Address stored IN pointer 'p_a': 0x7ffdd91e2bd8
Address of pointer variable 'p_a' itself: 0x7ffdd91e2be0
```
