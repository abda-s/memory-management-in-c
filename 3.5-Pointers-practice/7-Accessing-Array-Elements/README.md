## Exercise 7: Accessing Array Elements

Practice Problem: Given an array, access and print the third element (index 2) using three different methods: subscript notation, pointer notation with the base address, and pointer notation with an offset pointer.

Given:
```c
int data[5] = {1, 3, 5, 7, 9};
```

Expected Output:
```
Array element at index 2 (Value should be 5):
1. Subscript notation: 5
2. Pointer notation (arr + 2): 5
3. Pointer notation (ptr + 2): 5
```
