## Exercise 2: Accessing Value (Dereferencing)
Practice Problem: Write a program that uses the dereference operator (*) to change the value of a variable through its pointer.

Given:
```c
int num = 100;
```

Expected Output:
```
Original value of num: 100
New value of num after pointer assignment: 500
```
