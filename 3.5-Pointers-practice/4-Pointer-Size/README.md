## Exercise 4: Pointer Size

Practice Problem: Write a program to print the size (in bytes) of a pointer to an integer, a pointer to a character, and a pointer to a float on your system.

Expected Output:
```
Size of int pointer (int *): 8 bytes
Size of char pointer (char *): 8 bytes
Size of float pointer (float *): 8 bytes

Size of 'int' variable: 4 bytes
Size of 'float' variable: 4 bytes
```
