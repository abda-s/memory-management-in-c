## Exercise 5: Passing by Reference

Practice Problem: Create a function increment_value that takes an integer pointer as an argument and increments the value of the variable it points to by one. Demonstrate the change in the main function.

Given:
```c
int count = 10;
```

Expected Output:
```
Before function call, count = 10
After function call, count = 11
```
