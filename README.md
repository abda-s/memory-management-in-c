# Boot.dev Memory Management In C Course (Local C Environment)

This repository contains the exercises for the [Boot.dev Memory Management in C](https://www.boot.dev/courses/learn-memory-management-c) course Also here is the [5hrs video on YouTube](https://youtu.be/rJrd2QMVbGM?si=8Xdew37fPvsjNQfH).

It is configured to run in **GitHub Codespaces** or any **Local Linux Environment** using a 32-bit environment to strictly match the course's requirements (4-byte pointers). It also includes a compatibility layer (`bootdev_shim.h`) that allows the browser-based code to run locally without modification.

## 🎯 My Embedded Journey (ESP32 / ESP-IDF)

I am using this course and repository specifically to practice C for **embedded systems programming** (focusing on ESP32 and ESP-IDF). 

Because of this specific hardware focus:
* **Custom Chapter 8 (Bitwise Operations):** I have manually added a completely custom `8-Bitwise-Operations` chapter to this repository. This chapter is **not** part of the original Boot.dev course. The curriculum, explanations, and lesson files for this chapter were **generated by AI** using [this excellent YouTube video by Core Dumped](https://youtu.be/z7wVUfnm7M0?si=f_rdDpsVf0FPImJX) as a core reference, but **the solutions were completely written by me**. I designed it to practice and master bitwise logic, hardware register manipulation (simulating ESP32 `W1TS` and `W1TC` registers), and memory-efficient bit-packing for embedded devices.
* **Custom Chapter 3.5 (Pointers Practice):** I also added another custom chapter `3.5-Pointers-practice`. It contains 13 granular practice problems focused heavily on pointer syntax, pointer arithmetic, dereferencing, and basic `malloc` usage to bridge the gap before the more advanced Pointer chapters in the Boot.dev course.
* **Skipped Chapters:** For now, I have skipped the remaining chapters of the original course, as I feel they are less relevant to my immediate goals in embedded systems programming.

## 🛠️ One-Time Setup (If you fork this repo)

When you first open this repository in a GitHub Codespace or a standard 64-bit Linux distribution (like Ubuntu/Debian), you need to install the C toolchain and configure the compilation shortcut.

**Open your terminal and run this entire block:**

```bash
# 1. Install 32-bit compiler tools and debuggers
sudo apt-get update && sudo apt-get install -y build-essential valgrind gdb gcc-multilib

# 2. Create the 'run' shortcut (Compiles + Runs)
echo 'alias run="gcc -m32 -g -I\$(git rev-parse --show-toplevel) -include \$(git rev-parse --show-toplevel)/bootdev_shim.h -o test_runner *.c \$(git rev-parse --show-toplevel)/munit.c && ./test_runner"' >> ~/.bashrc

# 3. Apply changes
source ~/.bashrc

```

* **`gcc-multilib`**: Allows compiling 32-bit code on a 64-bit machine.
* **`valgrind`**: The memory leak detector used in the course.
* **`run`**: Compiles and runs your current lesson.

## 📂 Directory Structure

To make the automation work, keep the library files in the **root** folder. Organize your lessons however you like inside subfolders.

```text

├── munit.h               <-- DO NOT MOVE (Testing Library Header)
├── bootdev_shim.h        <-- DO NOT MOVE (Compatibility Layer for Boot.dev code)

## 🚀 How to Run Code

1. Navigate to the `starter` or `solution` folder of the specific lesson you are working on:
```bash
cd Chapter_1/Lesson_1/starter
```

2. Run the helper command:
```bash
run
```

This will:

1. Compile all `.c` files in your current folder.
2. Automatically inject the compatibility layer (`bootdev_shim.h`).
3. Link them against `munit.c`.
4. Force 32-bit mode (`-m32`).
5. Run the executable immediately if compilation succeeds.
